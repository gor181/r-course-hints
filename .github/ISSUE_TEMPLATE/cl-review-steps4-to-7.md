### Step 4: Capstone Exercises
- [ ] Is there **one** capstone exercise per chapter?
- [ ] Do the capstone exercises meet our [content guidelines](https://instructor-support.datacamp.com/courses/course-development/content-guidelines)?
- [ ] Does the build of the course pass?

### Step 5: Build ONE Complete Lesson on the Teach Editor
#### General
- [ ] Does the lesson consist of 1 video followed by 2-4 exercises?
- [ ] Are there at least 2 coding exercises?
- [ ] Is there no more than 1 multiple choice exercise?
- [ ] Is the script for the video between 400 and 600 words?
- [ ] Are the titles of the exercises and slides written in sentence case (sentence case preferred)?
- [ ] Do all of the exercises run on DataCamp in less than 3 seconds?
- [ ] Does the build pass?

#### Video

- [ ] Are the slides dynamic? That is, is there movement on the slides, such as in the form of transitions between bullets and lines of code, or progression through a visual/schema?
- [ ] Are full sentences in slides avoided?
- [ ] Is there a clear learning objective and/or narrative that motivates why the concept is important?
- [ ] Is there code in the slides? Learning by Doing requires Teaching by Doing!
- [ ] Does the code incorporate a relevant dataset that is [not overused](https://instructor-support.datacamp.com/frequently-asked-questions-faq/datasets/datasets-to-avoid)?
- [ ] Is the code properly formatted and placed inside backticks? It is your responsibility to ensure that your slides are properly formatted.
- [ ] Is the (trans)script written in complete sentences, without any bullet points or markdown? The script should correspond to exactly what you will say in the final recording and will be used to generate the subtitles for your course.

#### Exercises

- [ ] Are the [Content Guidelines](https://instructor-support.datacamp.com/courses/course-development/content-guidelines) met?
- [ ] Context: 180-780 characters
- [ ] Instructions: 1-4 bulleted instructions
- [ ] Hints: 1-4 bulleted hints
- [ ] Sample/Solution code: Less than or equal to 15 lines of code
- [ ] Success Message: Is there an informative success message?
- [ ] Do the comments in the sample and solution code match?
- [ ] Are the comments abbreviated instructions?
- [ ] Are the comments free of backticks?
- [ ] Is each comment less than 60 characters of length?
- [ ] Does each comment start with a space?
- [ ] Are different sections of code properly spaced?
- [ ] Are the instructions bulleted?
- [ ] Are the hints bulleted?
- [ ] Is the sample code appropriately scaffolded? R courses use 3 underscores.

### Step 7: Write Course Description and List Course Prerequisites

Does the course description:
- [ ] Start with a hook to catch readers' attention?
- [ ] Explain why the subject is important, and to whom?
- [ ] Mention a specific problem that the learner will be able to solve after completing the course?
- [ ] Are 1-4 prerequisite DataCamp courses listed?
